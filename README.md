### Hello

On Github, I am primarily known for authoring and maintaining several [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) plugins.

These days, between work and family I have very little free time available. I can no longer get to every reported issue, so I have implemented a priority queue:

1. Pull requests - these are the highest priority for me and will be looked at first.
1. After PRs, I will triage new issues with `P0`, `P1`, and `P2` labels.
1. `P0` issues will be worked on as soon as possible.
1. `P1` issues may get worked on when I get spare time and feel like it, which is uncommon these days.
1. `P2` issues will not be worked on. Pull requests are the only way to move these forward.
